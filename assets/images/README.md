# Images Directory

Place your images in this directory. The website references the following images:

## Required Images:
- `overview.png` - Main overview image of your framework (displayed at the top of the page)
- `placeholder-1.png` - System Architecture image
- `placeholder-2.png` - Experimental Setup image
- `placeholder-3.png` - Results Visualization image
- `placeholder-4.png` - Multi-Agent Coordination image

## Image Guidelines:
- **Format**: PNG, JPG, or WebP
- **Recommended width**: 1200-1600px for overview image, 800-1200px for gallery images
- **File size**: Keep under 2MB for optimal loading speed
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names with hyphens (e.g., `system-architecture.png`)

## How to Add Images:
1. Copy your images to this directory
2. Update the `src` attributes in `index.html` to match your image filenames
3. Update alt text and captions for accessibility

Example:
```html
<img src="assets/images/your-image.png" alt="Description" class="overview-image">
```

## Tips:
- Use high-quality images that clearly show your work
- Include diagrams, screenshots, and experimental results
- Compress images before uploading to reduce page load time
- Consider using tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim for compression
